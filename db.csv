The rocks were complex and the area was very difficult to work in with no roads and dense forests. Early ideas were that the [Shield] was simply cooled [Crust] in keeping with the notion of a once molten planet. Observations of the deformed [Marble]s of the Hastings Highlands in the 1850's by Sir William Logan and others area resulted in the new notion that much rock had been sedimentary in origin but much altered by [Metamorphism] (Sites [C115]). The term'Hastings Series' was used in the 1860's to refer to such [Strata].  Final understanding about 100 years later had to await the identification of'terranes' or large blocks of rock that formerly had been small landmasses or islands made up of sedimentary [Strata] and all brought together and deformed by plate tectonic processes about 1 billion years ago during[ Formation ]of the Grenville Mountains and the [Supercontinent] [Rodinia].,y,45.246692,-77.947323,86.93,0,0.96,n,13,a,4,http://planetrocks.ca/wp-content/uploads/C127.png

Some 12,500 years ago, much of the Toronto area was flooded by glacial Lake Iroquois which was some 45 metres deeper (higher) than the modern Lake Ontario. This was because the last [Ice sheet] still blocked the St.Lawrence River valley (the outlet of the Great Lakes) creating an enormous ice-dammed lake. The shoreline of this lake is still visible today (Site [S14]). The lake drained very quickly when the plug (ice) was pulled out of the St.Lawrence and lake levels dropped to well below that of the modern Lake Ontario.  Much of the area now covered by Lake Ontario was in fact dry land because sea level was still low; huge volumes of water which would otherwise flow to the sea still remained trapped in the [Ice sheet] that lingered over northern Canada).

Earth History,462,w42,Iceberg!,,42.217394,-82.80824,"At the end of the last [Ice age] some 12,000 years ago todays Great Lakes were ponded up as huge ice dammed lakes. Hundreds of ice bergs were pushed by wind into shallow waters to ground on the lake floor leaving long straight (often cross-cutting) grooves called 'iceberg scours.' These are common on the flat now exposed floors of the Greater Lakes which are referred to a 'clay plains' such as in southwestern Ontario around Windsor, and in the north around New Liskeard.

Earth History,463,w43,Blue Mountain,Skiing the Silurian,44.518989,-80.338673,Blue Mountain is the local name used for the Niagara [Escarpment] (Site [S36]) where it overlooks Georgian Bay. The steep face of the [Escarpment] is created by the presence of strong resistant rocks that are much harder than those underneath which form the low lying areas below (and much of the floor of Georgian Bay to the north). The soft rocks are of late [Ordovician] age (about 450 million years old) and dominated by [Shale] which can be seen on the Georgian Bay coast nearby at Craigleith (Site [W23]). The [Escarpment] rocks are [Dolostones] (altered [Limestones]) and are of [Silurian] age (440 to about 428 million). So next time you ski at Blue Mountain you are going downhill but backwards in time to an age when Ontario was covered by shallow warm seas.  ,y,44.507502,-80.329859,49.61,0,-11.89,n,13,,6,http://planetrocks.ca/wp-content/uploads/W43.png
Historic,464,w44,Southwold Earthworks ,National Historic Site of Canada,42.674501,-81.36005,"This is the remains of a Neutral Attiwandaronk First Nations palisaded village built some 500 years ago near present day Iona in Elgin County. It was constructed to protect its inhabitants, who lived in several longhouses inside palisaded mounds, from the many dangerous conflicts that swirled across what is now southern Ontario. Attiwandaronk is derived from the Huron-Wendat language identifying a confederacy of Iroquoian north of Lake Erie. These peoples were neutral in the conflict between the Huron-Wendat and the League of Five Nations Iroquois who subsumed the village in about 1650.

Historic,465,w45,The Tiger Dunlop Trail ,"Maitland River, Goderich",43.758967,-81.701433,"Tiger Dunlop (1792-1848) was an Army surgeon who saw much action during the War of 1812 at the Battle of Crysler's Farm and at Lundy's Lane. He later commanded a regiment of militia during the Rebellions of 1837 nicknamed the 'Bloody Useless.'  The easy-going Tiger Dunlop Heritage Trail commences by the CPR Station at Goderich Harbour continuing to the Menesetung Bridge built in 1907 with its marvellous view of the Maitland River.  The trail follows the abandoned rail line to the Tomb of Tiger Dunlop and is part of a larger loop trail system. The Maitland River is an exceptional example of a meandering river that has cut down deeply into glacial sediments at a time of much lowered lake levels when much of the floor of Lake Huron was dry about 8,000 years ago. This was the warmest part of the last 10,000 years. The Goderich salt mine is close by (Site [W10]).",n,,,,,,n,15,,5,http://planetrocks.ca/wp-content/uploads/W45.png
Nature,466,w46,Point Pelee National Park,,41.932849,-82.516144,The southernmost point in mainland Canada and a haven for birdwatchers (360 species have been recorded) especially during the[ Spring ]and Fall migrations. This triangular shaped piece of land that juts out into Lake Erie  is a classic example of a 'spit' built of[ Sand ]and [Gravel] moved along in the nearshore zone of Lake Erie by strong (and often dangerous) 'longshore' currents driven by persistent winds from the southwest (See [W1]). It was declared a National Park in 1918. Thousands of Monarch butterflies land here between August and October before heading off across the lake at its shortest crossing.,n,,,,,,y,13,,8,http://planetrocks.ca/wp-content/uploads/W46.png
Earth History,467,w47,Pelee Island,,41.827491,-82.635991,Pelee island contains Canada's most southerly residential community and is made of Middle [Devonian] Dundee[ Formation ][Limestones] about 400 million years old. It lies within a[ Group ]of islands that form dangerous shoals at the western end of Lake Erie and can be reached by ferry from Leamington. A lighthouse at the northern end of the island marks the southern limit of the deeper water Pelee Passage between Pelee Island and the southern tip of Point Pelee ([W46]). The island is an extensive [Limestone] plains called an 'alvar' ([C24]) which in the southwest part of the island at Stone Road Alvar have been deeply grooved by abrasion below the last [Ice sheet]. These are spectacularly exposed on nearby Kelley's Island in Ohio ([W35]).,n,,,,,,n,11,,6,http://planetrocks.ca/wp-content/uploads/W47.png
